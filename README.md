# Wasserstein-GAN-for-Stock-price

Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) is a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that addresses some of the training instabilities faced by traditional GANs. It can be applied to generate synthetic stock or time series data.

Here's a breakdown of WGAN and its implementation for time series data:

WGAN in a Nutshell:

Goal: Like all GANs, WGAN aims to train a generative model (G) to create realistic data samples that resemble the real data distribution (from which you have historical stock prices or time series data).
The Adversarial Process: Similar to traditional GANs, WGAN has two competing models:
Generator (G): This model learns to create new data samples.
Discriminator (D): This model tries to distinguish between real data and the data generated by G.
The Difference: WGAN uses a different loss function compared to traditional GANs. This loss function is based on Wasserstein distance, which helps improve training stability.
Implementing WGAN for Time Series Data:

Data Preprocessing: Prepare your stock or time series data. This might involve normalization, scaling, or windowing the data into sequences for the model.
Model Architecture:
Generator (G): This can be a recurrent neural network (RNN) like LSTM or GRU, which are adept at handling sequential data. G takes noise as input and outputs synthetic time series data.
Discriminator (D): This can also be an RNN that analyzes sequences and outputs a probability of whether the sequence is real or generated.
Training: Train the WGAN in an iterative manner:
G tries to generate data that fools D into thinking it's real.
D tries to improve its ability to distinguish real from generated data.
Evaluation: Monitor the training process and evaluate the generated data. Metrics like mean squared error or similarity measures can be used to assess how well the generated data resembles the real data distribution.
Challenges and Considerations:

Training WGANs can still be complex and require careful hyperparameter tuning.
Capturing long-term dependencies in time series data can be challenging for the model.
The generated data might not perfectly replicate real-world complexities, so it's crucial to use it cautiously, especially for financial predictions.

Remember: While WGAN offers promise for generating synthetic time series data, it's important to understand its limitations and use it responsibly, particularly in financial contexts.
